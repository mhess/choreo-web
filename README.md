# CHOREO

The **Choreo** web app allows you to annote time points in audio tracks and use those annotations to seek through the track.

The idea was born out of the frustrating experience of trying to compose a dance choreography using the UI from typical music streaming services.

The app can consume audio from a Spotify premium account, YouTube, or a local audio file on disk.
